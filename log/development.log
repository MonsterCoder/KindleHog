Finding cool languages, tools, or development techniques is  easy-new ones are popping up every day.  Convincing co-workers to adopt  them is the hard part.  The problem is political, and in political  fights, logic doesn&#8217;t win for logic&#8217;s sake. Hard evidence of a superior  solution is not enough.  But that reality can be tough for programmers  to overcome.</p>
<p>In <em>Driving Technical Change: Why People On Your Team Don&#8217;t Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should</em>,  Adobe software evangelist Terrence Ryan breaks down the patterns and  types of resistance technologists face in many organizations.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get a rich understanding of what blocks users from accepting your  solutions.  From that, you&#8217;ll get techniques for dismantling their  objections-without becoming some kind of technocratic Machiavelli.</p>
<p>In Part I, Ryan clearly defines the problem.  Then in Part II, he  presents &#8220;resistance patterns&#8221;-there&#8217;s a pattern for each type of person  resisting your technology, from The Uninformed to The Herd, The Cynic,  The Burned, The Time Crunched, The Boss, and The Irrational.  In Part  III, Ryan shares his battle-tested techniques for overcoming users&#8217;  objections.  These build on expertise, communication, compromise, trust,  publicity, and similar factors.  In Part IV, Ryan reveals strategies  that put it all together-the patterns of resistance and the techniques  for winning buy-in.  This is the art of organizational politics.</p>
<p><span id="more-7491"></span>In the end, change is a two-way street:  In order to get your  co-workers to stretch their technical skills, you&#8217;ll have to stretch  your soft skills.  This book will help you make that stretch without  compromising your resistance to playing politics.  You can overcome  resistance-however illogical-in a logical way.</p>
<p><strong>About the Author</strong><br />
Terrence Ryan currently works as an Evangelist for Adobe  Systems. He focuses on the promotion of ColdFusion, Flash, Flex and AIR.  As an evangelist his job is to encourage people to try new tools and  techniques. Before that, he spent ten years in higher education  overseeing the work of a team of developers, running code reviews,  pushing standards, and trying to convince co-workers to come around to  new tools and techniques.</p>

The JavaScript ecosystem can be tough to hack through, even  for experienced programmers.  There are so many extensive JavaScript  reference books and competing libraries to choose from-Prototype,  jQuery, MooTools, YUI, Dojo, ExtJS, and so on.</p>
<p>Christophe  Porteneuve is here to help: he gives you fundamentals, the most handy  techniques, and the insider&#8217;s best practices.  If you&#8217;re reasonably  comfortable programming in any widely known language, you&#8217;ll be able to  jump into JavaScript in no time.</p>
<p>Divided into six Parts, the  book starts with JavaScript code patterns that are too often ignored by  JavaScript coders. Part 2 presents several essential JavaScript  tasks-DOM and CSS manipulations, plus event handling and timers-in a  framework-agnostic way, using syntax from all the major flavors.  Parts 3  and 4, respectively, hit JavaScript&#8217;s best features for user interface  functionality-tooltips, lightboxes, image processing, infinite  scrolling, and more-and forms for receiving and validating input.  Part 5  explores the client/server relationship, touching on cookies, JSON, and  Ajax (same- and cross-domain).  Part 6 uses JavaScript in mashups with  Twitter, Flickr, and geo-related APIs.</p>
<p>The appendices feature  Christophe&#8217;s two-page JavaScript cheat sheet, followed by hard-won tips  on debugging even the most maddening JavaScript errors.  Next is an  even-handed assessment of the major frameworks used in the book and in  most JavaScript shops today.  Last, Christophe presents an extensive  group of resources for using and learning JavaScript and the major  frameworks.<span id="more-7489"></span></p>
<p>This Pragmatic Guide is strictly focused on the  techniques that will get you started in JavaScript.  It&#8217;s where you come  to get the full scope of JavaScript in your head&#8211;fast!  You&#8217;ll quickly  understand its core syntax, capabilities, and related frameworks.   Start here first.</p>

Subversion sets the standard in version control systems.  Championed by open-source developers, Subversion is behind some of  today&#8217;s biggest and most important software, including Apache, FreeBSD,  Ruby, and MediaWiki. But more than just a tool for open-source  collaboration, Subversion has made a significant impact in the corporate  IT world. Most developers will now encounter Subversion source control  during their career.</p>
<p>As a developer, you probably have knowledge  of more than one source control tool and are expected to fluidly switch  between tools depending on where you are working. This book was written  to bridge the gap between knowing something about version control in  general and knowing about Subversion specifically.</p>
<p>In <em>Pragmatic Guide to Subversion</em>,  author Mike Mason drives developers to the features and practices that  have made Subversion so successful. Each of the 48 tasks selected for  the book is presented as a quick two-pager, with a succinct description  on the left side and a quick reference on the right. The book is  designed for experienced developers who know how to learn and want to  get straight to the tricks and traps they&#8217;d otherwise learn by trial and  error.</p>
<p>Subversion started life as a command-line tool but  graphical clients are now extremely popular and can offer a lot of extra  power. For every task in <em>Pragmatic Guide to Subversion</em>, you get  to see how to carry out the task via the regular command-line client as  well as the TortoiseSVN graphical client for Windows, and the  Cornerstone graphical client for Mac.<span id="more-7487"></span></p>
<p>Whether or not you&#8217;ve used  other version control tools, you&#8217;ll learn Subversion&#8217;s popular way of  working-how to access your source code, make changes, and share them  with your team. Each of the development tasks selected for the book  gives simple steps toward completion, paired with a clear explanation.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find a more practical approach to learning Subversion than <em>Pragmatic Guide to Subversion</em>.</p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong><br />
Tim Kashani, founder and CEO of IT  Mentors and author, has trained more than 100,000 students worldwide. He  builds scorecards to track how many vegetables his son consumes daily.  Tim thinks increasing is better. His son wants more information before  making a strategic decision on the issue.</p>
<p>Ola Ekdahl has worked with PerformancePoint since its early alpha stages, as a  trainer, content creator, and author, and has extensive experience  developing business intelligence solutions. He’s currently developing a  KPI measuring how much catnip his cats can consume. The cats think they  should use increasing is better but Ola disagrees.</p>
<p>Kevin Beto,  a 10-year Microsoft veteran, is currently a test lead on the Microsoft  SharePoint BI team. He builds scorecards to track his performance in arm  wrestling and twister contests. The calculations and thresholds for  these scorecards test the outer limits of performance monitoring and  business intelligence.</p>
<p>Rachel Vigier is a writer. She has authored two volumes of poetry, a book about  dance, and many technical and business works. She uses scorecards to  track how many books her family reads. Increasing is definitely better  and so far everybody consistently exceeds targets.</p>

This is the second edition of David Power&#8217;s highly-respected <strong><em>PHP Solutions: Dynamic Web Design Made Easy</em></strong>.  This new edition has been updated by David to incorporate changes to  PHP since the first edition and to offer the latest techniques&#8211;a  classic guide modernized for 21st century PHP techniques, innovations,  and best practices.</p>
<p>You want to make your websites more  dynamic by adding a feedback form, creating a private area where members  can upload images that are automatically resized, or perhaps storing  all your content in a database. The problem is, you&#8217;re not a programmer  and the thought of writing code sends a chill up your spine. Or maybe  you&#8217;ve dabbled a bit in PHP and MySQL, but you can&#8217;t get past baby  steps. If this describes you, then you&#8217;ve just found the right book. PHP  and the MySQL database are deservedly the most popular combination for  creating dynamic websites. They&#8217;re free, easy to use, and provided by  many web hosting companies in their standard packages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most PHP books either expect you to be an expert already  or force you to go through endless exercises of little practical value.  In contrast, this book gives you real value right away through a series  of practical examples that you can incorporate directly into your sites,  optimizing performance and adding functionality such as file uploading,  email feedback forms, image galleries, content management systems, and  much more. Each solution is created with not only functionality in mind,  but also visual design.<span id="more-7483"></span></p>
<p>But this book doesn&#8217;t just provide a  collection of ready-made scripts: each PHP Solution builds on what&#8217;s  gone before, teaching you the basics of PHP and database design quickly  and painlessly. By the end of the book, you&#8217;ll have the confidence to  start writing your own scripts or&#8211;if you prefer to leave that task to  others&#8211;to adapt existing scripts to your own requirements. Right from  the start, you&#8217;re shown how easy it is to protect your sites by adopting  secure coding practices.</p>
<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll learn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updates to the first edition with the latest PHP techniques for modern, dynamic web design</li>
<li>Create dynamic websites with design and usability in mind, as well as functionality</li>
<li>Understand how PHP scripts work, giving you confidence to adapt them to your own needs</li>
<li>Bring online forms to life, check required fields, and ensure user input is safe to process</li>
<li>Upload files and automatically create thumbnails from larger images</li>
<li>Manage website content with a searchable database</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who this book is for</strong><br />
This is a &#8220;must have&#8221; reference book for any Web developer using PHP  scripting language. If you have read the first edition classic, then  this update will bring you the latest PHP techniques and best practices.  If you are new to dynamic web design with PHP, then David will  introduce you to the core techniques and methods for dynamic PHP web  sites, ready for the 21st century!</p>
<p><strong>About the Author</strong><br />
David Powers is the author of a series of highly successful books on  PHP, Dreamweaver, and web development. He began developing websites in  1994 when &#8211; as Editor, BBC Japanese TV &#8211; he needed a way to promote his  fledgling TV channel, but didn&#8217;t have an advertising budget. He  persuaded the IT department to let him have some space on the BBC&#8217;s  server, and hand-coded a bilingual website from scratch. That experience  ignited a passion for web development that consumes him to this day.</p>
<p>David is an Adobe Community Professional  and Adobe Certified Instructor for Dreamweaver. In 2010, he became one  of the first people to qualify as a PHP 5.3 Zend Certified Engineer.</p>

Drupal is a content management framework that powers web  sites from simple online brochures to more advanced sites including  social networking sites, blogs, e-commerce sites, business portals, and  more. It is free, open source software that allows anyone to quickly and  easily build web sites. Its full range of modules—including user  permissions, security mechanisms, JavaScript menus, image uploaders,  WYSIWYG editors, and more— helps you easily create the foundation for a  powerful web site. With its templating system (and a few tips and  tricks), any graphic design file can be used to create a Drupal web  site.</p>
<p><em>Foundation Drupal 7</em> covers all the topics  necessary to quickly build Drupal-powered web sites, explaining in  simple terms how Drupal works and providing you with concepts, tips, and  code snippets for every step of the development process. From setting  up a Drupalready web host and installing Drupal to using the  administrative interface and configuring a site from start to finish,  there is something here for everyone. In addition to thoroughly  discussing all of Drupal’s core modules, this book reviews more than 50  contributed modules, including WYSIWYG HTML editors, JavaScript  drop-down menus, web forms, and even the powerful Views module.  Stephanie Pakrul, creator and maintainer of the Fusion theme, coauthors a  chapter on how to lay out and add graphics to a site through Drupal’s  administrative section. After reading this book, you will walk away with  everything you need to know to quickly and successfully build a  Drupal-powered web site.</p>

Most security books on Java focus on cryptography and access  control, but exclude key aspects such as coding practices, logging, and  web application risk assessment. Encapsulating security requirements for  web development with the Java programming platform, <em><strong>Secure Java: For Web Application Development</strong></em> covers secure programming, risk assessment, and threat  modeling—explaining how to integrate these practices into a secure  software development life cycle.</p>
<p>From the risk  assessment phase to the proof of concept phase, the book details a  secure web application development process. The authors provide in-depth  implementation guidance and best practices for access control,  cryptography, logging, secure coding, and authentication and  authorization in web application development. Discussing the latest  application exploits and vulnerabilities, they examine various options  and protection mechanisms for securing web applications against these  multifarious threats. The book is organized into four sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a clear view of the growing footprint of web applications</li>
<li>Explores the foundations of secure web application development and the risk management process</li>
<li>Delves into tactical web application security development with Java EE</li>
<li>Deals extensively with security testing of web applications</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-7463"></span>This  complete reference includes a case study of an e-commerce company  facing web application security challenges, as well as specific  techniques for testing the security of web applications. Highlighting  state-of-the-art tools for web application security testing, it supplies  valuable insight on how to meet important security compliance  requirements, including PCI-DSS, PA-DSS, HIPAA, and GLBA. The book also  includes an appendix that covers the application security guidelines for  the payment card industry standards.</p>

<em><strong>Solaris™ Application Programming</strong></em> is a comprehensive guide to optimizing the performance of applications  running in your Solaris environment. From the fundamentals of system  performance to using analysis and optimization tools to their fullest,  this wide-ranging resource shows developers and software architects how  to get the most from Solaris systems and applications.</p>
<p>Whether  you’re new to performance analysis and optimization or an experienced  developer searching for the most efficient ways to solve performance  issues, this practical guide gives you the background information, tips,  and techniques for developing, optimizing, and debugging applications  on Solaris.</p>
<p>The  text begins with a detailed overview of the components that affect  system performance. This is followed by explanations of the many  developer tools included with Solaris OS and the Sun Studio compiler,  and then it takes you beyond the basics with practical, real-world  examples. In addition, you will learn how to use the rich set of  developer tools to identify performance problems, accurately interpret  output from the tools, and choose the smartest, most efficient approach  to correcting specific problems and achieving maximum system  performance.</p>
<p><span id="more-7461"></span>Coverage includes</p>
<ul>
<li> A  discussion of the chip multithreading (CMT) processors from Sun and how  they change the way that developers need to think about performance</li>
<li> A detailed introduction to the performance analysis and optimization tools included with the Solaris OS and Sun Studio compiler</li>
<li> Practical  examples for using the developer tools to their fullest, including  informational tools, compilers, floating point optimizations, libraries  and linking, performance profilers, and debuggers</li>
<li> Guidelines for interpreting tool analysis output</li>
<li> Optimization, including hardware performance counter metrics and source code optimizations</li>
<li> Techniques for improving application performance using multiple processes, or multiple threads</li>
<li> An overview of hardware and software components that affect system performance, including coverage of SPARC and x64 processors</li>
</ul>

Are you looking for a deeper  understanding of the Java™ programming language so that you can write  code that is clearer, more correct, more robust, and more reusable? Look  no further! <em><strong><em>Effective Java™, Second Edition,</em></strong></em> brings together seventy-eight indispensable programmer’s rules of thumb:  working, best-practice solutions for the programming challenges you  encounter every day.</p>
<p>This  highly anticipated new edition of the classic, Jolt Award-winning work  has been thoroughly updated to cover Java SE 5 and Java SE 6 features  introduced since the first edition. Bloch explores new design patterns  and language idioms, showing you how to make the most of features  ranging from generics to enums, annotations to autoboxing.</p>
<p>Each  chapter in the book consists of several “items” presented in the form  of a short, standalone essay that provides specific advice, insight into  Java platform subtleties, and outstanding code examples. The  comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate  what to do, what not to do, and why.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li> New coverage of generics, enums, annotations, autoboxing, the for-each loop, varargs, concurrency utilities, and much more</li>
<li> Updated techniques and best practices on classic topics, including objects, classes, libraries, methods, and serialization<span id="more-7456"></span></li>
<li> How to avoid the traps and pitfalls of commonly misunderstood subtleties of the language</li>
<li> Focus  on the language and its most fundamental libraries: java.lang,  java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.util.concurrent and java.io</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, <strong><em><strong>Effective Java™, Second Edition,</strong></em></strong> presents the most practical, authoritative guidelines available for writing efficient, well-designed programs.</p>
<p><strong>About the Author</strong><br />
Joshua Bloch is chief Java architect at  Google and a Jolt Award winner. He was previously a distinguished  engineer at Sun Microsystems and a senior systems designer at Transarc.  Bloch led the design and implementation of numerous Java platform  features, including JDK 5.0 language enhancements and the award-winning  Java Collections Framework. He coauthored <em>Java™ Puzzlers </em>(Addison-Wesley, 2005) and <em>Java™ Concurrency in Practice </em>(Addison-Wesley, 2006).</p>

<em><strong>A must have guide for creating engaging and usable SharePoint 2010 branding</strong></em></p>
<p>With SharePoint 2010, Microsoft has provided a more robust  environment for creating collaboration and content management sites that  rival any of the popular websites on the internet. Creating a branded  SharePoint site involves understanding both traditional web design  techniques as well as topics that are typically reserved for developers.  This book bridges that gap by not only providing expert guidance for  creating beautiful public facing and internal intranet sites but it also  addresses the needs of those readers that only want to understand the  basics enough to apply some style to their sites.</p>
<p>Things  like creative design, the experience visitors have navigating your user  interface, ease of use?these are all important branding considerations  and not always intuitive. This unique book from a team of SharePoint  branding experts lays it all out. The book is divided into four  sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction to SharePoint Branding:</strong> In this part you will learn about what SharePoint branding is and how the topic has changed since SharePoint 2007.</li>
<li><strong>Branding Basics:</strong> This section is geared towards both getting started as well as being a  guide for people that don?t want to dive super deep into the advanced  topics of SharePoint branding. You will learn about how to plan for  branding projects, including creating wireframes and creative mockups as  well as gathering requirements and estimation.<span id="more-7448"></span> You will learn how to  work with SharePoint Designer 2010, SharePoint 2010 themes, and  SharePoint navigation as well as gain an understanding of the low and  medium effort approaches to branding can be used to make SharePoint look  more like your own visual style.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Branding:</strong> This is where you will learn about the more intricate techniques for  making large changes to the SharePoint UI, such as cascading style  sheets (CSS), master pages, page layouts, web parts and XSLT. You will  also get an introduction to deploying SharePoint branding to production  servers using solution packages (WSP).</li>
<li><strong>Other Topics:</strong> Everything else that is related to SharePoint branding is discussed  here, including working with the SharePoint 2010 ribbon and client side  technologies such as the client object model, jQuery, and Silverlight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you want to make SharePoint look completely different or  just make minor design changes, this expert guide will provide tips,  techniques, and insights to get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>From the Back Cover</strong><br />

SAP Implementation Unleashed. A Business and Technical Roadmap to Deploying SAP</p>
<p>SAP  can help you capture better information and deliver it more quickly,  allowing you to make better decisions and maximize the business value of  everything you do.

In <em>SAP Implementation Unleashed</em>,  10 expert SAP project managers, functional consultants, and  technologists guide you through the entire journey, helping you avoid  pain and pitfalls and gain all the benefits of SAP.</p>
<p>The  authors introduce start-to-finish business, technical, and project  management roadmaps for successful SAP implementation. Then, drawing on  their immense experience, they walk you through the entire process of  planning and deployment—addressing make-or-break issues and hidden gaps  that other guidebooks ignore. You’ll discover how to employ processes,  models, and toolsets that help you achieve implementation excellence  while systematically reducing cost and business risk. Along the way,  you’ll find actionable advice and real-world insight into innovative  project management, best-suited leadership, effective load testing,  contemporary infrastructure implementation, and more.</p>

<em><strong>Enhance Fundamental Value and Establish Competitive Advantage with Leadership Agility</strong></em></p>
<p>Whether you’re leading an organization, a team, or a project, <strong><em>Stand Back and Deliver</em></strong> gives you the agile leadership tools you’ll need to achieve  breakthrough levels of performance. This book brings together  immediately usable frameworks and step-by-step processes that help you  focus all your efforts where they matter most: delivering business value  and building competitive advantage.</p>
<p>You’ll  first discover how to use the authors’ Purpose Alignment Model to make  better up-front decisions about where to invest limited resources–and  how to filter out activities that don’t drive market leadership. Next,  you’ll learn how to collaborate in new ways that unleash your  organization’s full talents for innovation. The authors offer the  Context Leadership Model for understanding the unique challenges of any  project, and they help you tailor your leadership approach to address  them. You’ll find a full chapter on organizing information to promote  more effective, value-driven decision-making. Finally, drawing on  decades of experience working with great leaders, the authors focus on a  critical issue you’ll face over and over again: knowing when to step up  and lead, and when to stand back and let your team produce results.</p>

<em><strong>Complete, Hands-On Guide to Building Advanced Distributed Applications with Ruby</strong></em></p>
<p>Distributed  programming techniques make applications easier to scale, develop, and  deploy—especially in emerging cloud computing environments. Now, one of  the Ruby community’s leading experts has written the first definitive  guide to distributed programming with Ruby.</p>
<p>Mark  Bates begins with a simple distributed application, and then walks  through an increasingly complex series of examples, demonstrating  solutions to the most common distributed programming problems.</p>
<p>Bates  presents the industry’s most useful coverage of Ruby’s standard  distributed programming libraries, DRb and Rinda. Next, he introduces  powerful third-party tools, frameworks, and libraries designed to  simplify Ruby distributed programming, including his own Distribunaut.</p>
<p>If  you’re an experienced Ruby programmer or architect, this hands-on  tutorial and practical reference will help you meet any distributed  programming challenge, no matter how complex.</p>
<p><span id="more-7436"></span>Coverage includes:<br />
•   Writing robust, secure, and interactive applications using DRb—and managing its drawbacks<br />
•   Using Rinda to build applications with improved flexibility, fault tolerance, and service discovery<br />
•   Simplifying DRb service management with RingyDingy<br />
•   Utilizing Starfish to facilitate communication between distributed programs and to write MapReduce functions for processing large data sets<br />
•   Using Politics to customize the processes running on individual server instances in a cloud computing environment<br />
•   Providing reliable distributed queuing with the low-overhead Starling messaging server<br />
•   Implementing comprehensive enterprise messaging with RabbitMQ and Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)<br />

Mark Bates has been developing web  applications of one kind or another since 1996. He has spent an ungodly  amount of time programming Java, but thankfully he discovered Ruby in  late 2005, and life has been much nicer since.</p>
<p>Since  discovering Ruby, Mark has become a prominent member of the community.  He has developed various open-source projects, such as Configatron,  Cachetastic, Genosaurus, APN on Rails, and the Mack Framework, just to  name a few. The Mack Framework brought Mark to the forefront of  distributed programming in the Ruby community. Mack was a web framework  designed from the ground up to aid in the development of distributed  applications.</p>
<p>Mark  has taught classes on both Ruby and Ruby on Rails. He has spoken at  several Ruby gatherings, including 2008’s RubyConf, where he spoke about  building distributed applications.</p>
<p>Mark  has an honors degree in music from the Liverpool Institute for  Performing Arts. He still likes to rock out on the weekends, but set  times are now 10 p.m., not 2 a.m. He lives just outside of Boston with  his wife Rachel and their sons Dylan and Leo, whom he missed very much  when writing this book.</p>
